Infinity Cells
--------------

A - Booleans
(true -> false -> ...)

B - Boolean Operators
(not -> and -> or -> ...)

C - Concatentation Operators
(+ -> * -> ...)

D - Digits
Goes from 0 to 9, then loops.

E - Equality/Inequality Operators
(== -> != -> < -> <= -> > -> => -> ...)

I - Stdin Input
Characters go from Index 0 to Index (length of Stdin), then loops.

L - Lowercase Letters
Goes from a to z, then loops.

M - Math Operators 
(+ -> - -> * -> / -> ** -> % -> ...)

N - Bitwise Operators
(~ -> & -> | -> << -> >> -> >>> -> ...)

Accumulator
-----------

- Anytime you enter an infinity cell, you can pick up values and operators (but not directions).
- Items fill from left to right.
- Values are evalutated based on the operators arity and other things.
    - Unary operators 
        - Automatically evaluates the value to the left after that operator is obtained. (true not -> false).
        - If there are no values left of the unary operator, accumulator will be evaluated as AMORPHOUS.
        - If there is a type discrepancy when trying to evaluate, accumulator will be evaluated as AMORPHOUS
    - Binary operators
        - Automatically evalueates two values to the left and right after the right value is obtained. ("H" * 3 -> "HHH")
        - If there are no values left of the unary operator, accumulator will be evaluated as AMORPHOUS.
        - If there is a type discrepancy when trying to evaluate, accumulator will be evaluated as AMORPHOUS
- AMORPHOUS
    - If the accumulator has an AMORPHOUS atom, then every other pickup will be ignored until the accumulator is cleared.
    - Upon printing, it will print "AMORPHOUS".
    - AMORPHOUS is always false.
- NULL
    - Accumulator begins with NULL.
    - Upon printing, it will print nothing (or an empty string).
    - NULL is always false.
    - If you pick up a value or operator, it will supercede NULL.
- UNEVALUATED
    - If the accumulator is not evaluated yet, it will always be false.
    - If you print when the accumulator is not evaluateed yet, it will prit "UNEVALUATED".

Rules
-----

- Your pointer will start at the top left corner of your code.
- By default, the pointer moves right.
- The pointer will evaluate the tile it is on, then it will move in the current direction.
